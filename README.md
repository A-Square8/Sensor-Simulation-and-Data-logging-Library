# Multi-Sensor Library

A comprehensive library for interfacing with various sensors in embedded systems.

## Features

- Support for multiple sensor types
- Easy-to-use API for each sensor type
- Drift and error simulation for realistic sensor behavior
- Customizable parameters for each sensor

## Installation

1. Download the library files.
2. Include the desired sensor header files in your project.
3. Link against the library in your build system.

## Usage

```c
#include "thermooptical.h"

// Create a thermo-optical sensor instance
double temperature = 25.0;
int years = 2;
double emissivity = DEFAULT_EMISSIVITY;
double area = DEFAULT_AREA;
int drift_rate = 1;
int sensor_error = 2;

double power = cal_thermal_radiation(temperature, years, emissivity, area, drift_rate, sensor_error);
printf("Emitted power: %.6f W\n", power);
```
